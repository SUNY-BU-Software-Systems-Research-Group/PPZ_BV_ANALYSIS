There are three main components in this repository:
* "analysis_tools": Python-based paparazzi log data analysis tool
* "BV.xlsx": a detailed form of BV information
* other folders: stores case-by-case analysis of bounded variables in paparazzi codebase

Generating multi-variable figures for cross flight simulation can be done with...

$cd cross_sim_figures
$bash create_figures.sh
