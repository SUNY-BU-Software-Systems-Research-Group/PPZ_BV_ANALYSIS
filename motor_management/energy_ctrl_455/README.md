status: Diff
Notes: Interesting behavior. This one did make a difference in behavior for only the beginning of the simulation (as shown in bound_energy_ctrl.JPG and no_bound_energy_ctrl.JPG). The simulation log and data for no-bound simulation is also provided. Since it's an adaptive program, I believe that the learning feature is compensating for this fact.
