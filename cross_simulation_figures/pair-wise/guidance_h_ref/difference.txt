* Difference: When removing both of these bounds we see higher accelerometer values, and it even appears as though the uav has difficulty begining its circle routine.
* Property location in log: NPS_SENSORS_SCALED:acc_x of with BF pair case VS NPS_SENSORS_SCALED:acc_x of without BF pair case
	- Note: we only consider 0s~30s (when UAV is entering circle routine)
