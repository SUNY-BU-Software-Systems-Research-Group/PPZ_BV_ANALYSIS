* Difference: the desired altitude at the end of landing process are different according to log plotter
* Property location in log: DESIRED -> altitude
	- Note: the only difference of normal and abnormal simulation results is the DESIRED ALTITUDE at the end of landing, so it may not show in any computation of "mean errors"
