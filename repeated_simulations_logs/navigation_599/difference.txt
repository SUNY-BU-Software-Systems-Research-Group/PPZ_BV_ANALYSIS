* Difference: the carrot would move over the routine in absence of BF
* Property location in log: ROTORCRAFT_fp->carrot_east VS ROTORCRAFT_fp->east
	- Note: for alignment, we only consider the simulation log during time 100s ~ 130s (landing process of normal cases). You can also refer to "nav_gls_104_all_logs.JPG" to have a more direct view of the simulation results
