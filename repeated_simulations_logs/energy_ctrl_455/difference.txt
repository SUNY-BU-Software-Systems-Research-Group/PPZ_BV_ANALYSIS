* Difference: Without BF, the UAV can't stick to the intended trajectory at the beginning of entering circle routine
* Property location in log: DESIRED->course VS GPS->course
	- Note: we only consider 25s~40s in the simulation log (when the UAV just enters the circle routine) because we're only interested in the UAV's behavior of exceeding routine. You can also refer to "energy_ctrl_455_all_logs.png" to have a more direct view of the simulation results
