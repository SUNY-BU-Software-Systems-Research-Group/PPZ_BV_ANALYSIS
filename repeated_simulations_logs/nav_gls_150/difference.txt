* Difference: the changes of altitude are different according to log plotter
* Property location in log: DESIRED -> altitude of abnormal cases VS DESIRED -> altitude of normal cases
	- Note: for alignment, we only consider the simulation log during time 100s ~ 140s (landing process of normal cases). You can also refer to "nav_gls_150_all_logs.JPG" to have a more direct view of the simulation results
