* Difference: the changes of altitude are different according to log plotter
* Property location in log: GPS -> alt VS DESIRED -> altitude
	- Note: the calculation of "mean errors" might not show the difference between abnormal and normal cases. Because their difference is actually the duration of landing and the landing spot, but in our calculation of "mean errors", we compare simulation results against corresponding "desired values", which may not reflect the difference mentioned above.
